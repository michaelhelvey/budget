# Budget

Application for easily entering expenses in categories, purely intended for the
personal use of my wife and myself.

## Installation & Running Locally

Install project dependencies for the API:

- `pipenv sync --dev`

Use the built-in task runner to excute commands:

- `./x.py lint` (lints project with pycodestyle)
- `./x.py format` (formats project with autopep8)
- `./x.py test` (tests project with pytest)

## Design

Mocks for the application can be found on my personal Figma,
